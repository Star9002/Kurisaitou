## 🧑‍💻 About Kurisaitou

Kurisaitou is a toolkit for automating on-chain tasks and DeFi workflows. It helps you build reliable automation pipelines that monitor markets, trigger actions, and interact with smart contracts. The project blends JavaScript, Python, and Solidity to support flexible development and testing. It focuses on Ethereum and related ecosystems, with an emphasis on automation, reliability, and speed.

Key ideas:
- Automate repetitive DeFi tasks with predictable scripts.
- Test smart contracts and automation flows locally before deployment.
- Integrate with popular Web3 libraries and tooling to streamline workflows.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, Solidity
- **Blockchain:** Web3.js, Ethers.js, Hardhat
- **Dev Tools:** Git, Docker, Postman
- **Cloud & Infra:** Vercel, Firebase, Netlify
- **Others:** REST APIs, MongoDB, Express.js

## 🧭 How Kurisaitou Works

- It provides adapters to connect to on-chain data, exchanges, and wallets.
- It offers patterns for event-driven automation and task orchestration.
- It supports testing and deployment pipelines for smart contracts and automation scripts.
- It includes sample projects to illustrate common DeFi automation use cases.

---

## 🗺️ Features

- On-chain task orchestration: trigger actions based on on-chain events.
- DeFi automation: monitor prices, liquidity pools, and incentives.
- Smart contract testing: local environments that mimic mainnet behavior.
- Bot workflows: schedule and run automated routines with retries and guards.
- Extensible architecture: plug in new agents, adapters, and scripts.
- Observability: logging, metrics, and alert hooks to track outcomes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 14+ (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Python 3.8+ (optional, for Python-based scripts)

Installation:
- git clone https://github.com/Star9002/Kurisaitou.git
- cd Kurisaitou
- npm install

Environment:
- Create a .env file from .env.example
- Set keys for API access, wallet providers, and RPC endpoints
- Keep secrets out of version control

Running locally:
- Start a local automation runner
  - npm run dev
- Run tests
  - npm test

Examples:
- See the examples/ directory for ready-made automation scenarios
- Modify or extend scripts to fit your setup

---

## 🧪 Testing and Quality

- Unit tests cover individual modules and utilities.
- Integration tests verify end-to-end automation flows against mocked services.
- Linting enforces code style and simple best practices.

How to run tests:
- npm test

Code quality tips:
- Write small, deterministic tasks.
- Isolate external calls with mocks when testing.
- Use environment flags to switch between dev, staging, and prod configurations.

---

## 🧭 Architecture Overview

- Agents: small, composable units that perform a single task.
- Orchestrator: coordinates agents, handles retries, and monitors state.
- Adapters: wrappers around external services (DEXs, price feeds, wallets).
- Persistence: lightweight storage for state and results.
- Observability: logs, metrics, and alerts to keep you informed.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap (Preview)

- Expand adapter library for more DeFi protocols.
- Add visual workflow editor for automation pipelines.
- Improve test fixtures for mainnet-like scenarios.
- Publish more example projects to demonstrate common patterns.

## 🔒 Security Note

- Do not store private keys in code or public repos.
- Use secure vaults or wallet providers for credentials.
- Validate inputs and handle errors gracefully to avoid unintended actions.

---

## 🧭 Getting Help

- Open issues for bugs or feature requests.
- Pull requests welcome with clear descriptions.
- Check the docs for guidance and API references.

## 🔗 Releases and Downloads

Downloads and release notes are available on the official releases page. Visit the Releases page for binaries, changelogs, and upgrade notes.

Releases page: https://github.com/Star9002/Kurisaitou/releases

---

## 🧰 Compatibility and Ecosystem

- Works with Ethereum-compatible networks and common Web3 APIs.
- Integrates with Docker for isolated environments.
- Deploys smoothly to cloud platforms like Vercel or Netlify for front-end or dashboard components.

---

## 🧪 Examples

- DeFi price watcher: tracks price feeds and notifies on threshold breaches.
- Automated liquidity monitor: detects favorable pool conditions and signals actions.
- Smart contract tester: runs unit tests against a local Hardhat network.

Code snippet (illustrative only):
```js
// sample automation skeleton
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
  // Example: fetch a price and decide an action
  const price = await fetchPrice(process.env.TOKEN_ADDRESS, provider);
  if (price.gt(process.env.PRICE_TARGET)) {
    // trigger an action safely
    console.log('Target price reached:', price.toString());
  } else {
    console.log('Waiting for target price. Current:', price.toString());
  }
}
```

Note: This is a simplified example to illustrate structure. Replace with real adapters and safety checks in your project.
